
Methodology:
STL and data structures, most significantly, a trie, of C++ Programming language are used for searching the meaning of a given string and also updating the meaning. Various operations of Tries have been used like insertion, search and updation of word.
Dynamic Memory Allocation of the C++ class array is done to store the children array in the trie node. Recursive algorithms leverage the functioning of insert, search and update functions of class trie. String datatype is used with its STL commands to do various operations on strings.
File System Operations is used to store the word and meaning of word in the text file. Read and write operations are performed on text file.
